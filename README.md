# Hi, I'm Joss!
> (You try coming up with a logical nickname for Jocelyne.... Joc? Joce?) 

I'm currently exploring several career paths in tech and am looking to dive deeper into fullstack development, 
Product Management and Product Design! 


### Currently, 
* I'm on the job hunt! Looking for opportunities to develop my skills and further my understanding of what career paths are possible in tech. 

* Learning about embedded systems, data structures, and user centric design in my upcoming school term (May - August 2021)! Also learning about calculus. Less excited about that. 

* Volunteering as a project developer at [UW Blueprint](http://uwblueprint.org/)! Really looking forward to learning while contributing to software solutions that will amplify the impact of the charities we support. 

### What motivates me:
üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë  I'm highly collaborative and love working with, learning from, and creating opportunities for others. I feel most at home when I'm surrounded with people who love to give back. 

üèÜ  I'm most proud of the work I've done leading [SVP Teens](https://www.svpteens.org/) and developing at [UW Blueprint](http://uwblueprint.org/), two organizations where students apply their skills (technical or otherwise) to make a tangible impact on Charitites and Non Profit Organizations. 

üåç  I've also recently created an app to diagnose and refer Tuberculosis patients in partnership with [Dimagi](https://www.dimagi.com/), an international healthcare organization that has been leading the fight against child mortality and the COVID-19 pandemic.

ü§ì  Finally, nothing beats the thrill of learning something new, whether that be related to software, policy, design, history, or weird facts about space. Very succeptible to a good old fashioned [nerd snipe](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nerd-snipe).
