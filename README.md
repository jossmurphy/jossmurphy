## Hi, I'm Joss!
> (You try coming up with a nickname for Jocelyne.... Joc? Joce?) 

I'm currently exploring several career paths in tech and am looking to dive deeper into fullstack development, 
Product Management and Product Design! Currently I'm studying Systems Design Engineering @uwaterloo and developing @uwblueprint. 


### What motivates me:
🧑‍🤝‍🧑  I'm highly collaborative and love working with, learning from, and creating opportunities for others. 

🏠  I feel most at home when I'm surrounded with people who love to give back. 

🏆  I'm most proud of the work I've done leading SVP Teens and developing at UW Blueprint, two organizations where students to apply their skills (technical or otherwise) to make a tangible impact on Charitites and Non Profit Organizations. 

🌍  I've also recently created an app to diagnose and refer Tuberculosis patients in partnership Dimagi, an international healthcare organization that has been leading the fight against child mortality and the COVID-19 pandemic.

🤓  Finally, nothing beats the thrill of learning something new, whether that be related to software, policy, design, history, or even weird facts about space. Always looking to connect with other mega nerds.

### Currently, 
* I'm on the job hunt! Looking for opportunities to further my understanding of what career paths are possible in tech. 

* Learning about embedded systems, data structures, and user centric design in my upcoming school term (May - August 2021)! Also learning about calculus. Less excited about that. 

* Volunteering as a project developer @uwblueprint!! Really looking forward to learning while contributing to software solutions that will amplify the impact of the charities we support.
